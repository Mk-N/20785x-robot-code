# 20785x-robot-code
20785X's robot code, including both PROS and vexcode pro versions

The team's code is in a process of transitioning entirely to PROS. Only PROS code can be found in the pros-code branch. Current tested code is in main. Code where functionality is uncertain or is not to be used right now is in other branches.
